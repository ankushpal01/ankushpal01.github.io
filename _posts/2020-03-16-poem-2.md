```
And theyâ€™re modern lovers
With a hint of self annihilation 
Empty threats, fading colours 
Masochism gives rise to false elation

With every step, the thread comes loose
It gives them the edge & the thrill they seek
Each new day, it grows harder to choose
The mask they must put on to hide the weak 

Their days are numbered as we speak
The demise drawing eerily close
A warm welcome from the broken hearted clique 
Leaving behind traces in every prose 
                                                     
Children of unfulfilled hopes & dreams
Seeking love not from humans, but empty shells
Despondency, an overflowing stream
Leading to a never ending misery well
```
