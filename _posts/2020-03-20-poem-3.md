```
This is what it has come to be
No matter what I say, life isn’t for me 
I have changed for what they needed
But what I wanted to be, they didn’t like to see

This will affect me the most, I think
The dark liquid, I’m forced to drink
Block out the voices, pretentious crying 
Pushing to be alive, while I’d be better off dying 

One more step, I’m free falling 
To somewhere beyond, it’s calling 
Falling to a world devoid of trees
That void is where I’ll find peace 

In an instant, my soul shall be sold 
I hope you learn from my mistake and grow old
Please don’t get angry at me for not being strong 
I ran away because I felt like I didn’t belong 

While writing this, I wish I had already gone
I am sorry I couldn’t carry on 
I hope you remember the good too with the wrong 
Just shut your  eyes and move on. Winter will pass and spring shall arrive 
While into the deep water, I’ll dive
Everything will grow back 
It’s just my existence everyone will seem to lack
                                                                           — A
