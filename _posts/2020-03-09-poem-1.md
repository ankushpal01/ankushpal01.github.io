```
On the cold marble floor, I lay
Suffocating under a cushioned existence, I stay
But out there the earth’s at play
Angels gliding around in the sky
Sessile leaves yearning to sway
Fantasying the day away

The numb eerie sounds
Of unholy and forbidden grounds
A desperate few thirsty lips
While the ground splits and rip
Let the heavenly shower come
So we could offer thee a sip
Of the godly nectar 
It passes through the devil’s lair
Striped, red and white like a candy cane
Sucking everything, a hurricane

The monsoon is probably late
But will it be worth the wait
After paying admission at the gate
Treacherous soul full of guilt, wet 
This is what faltering patience shall get
A human tendency to gloat
Here comes Charon, on his boat 
Across the waters of Styx to guide thee
On to the underworld, to set your soul free. 

I’ve been replaced, yet again
Been so used to it, an absence of pain
You’re not the first one to do so
The tribulations often helps one to grow

Now we use each other’s names
Tired of these tedious and wicked games
Will you call him what you’d call me?
You’ve cut me off but I’m still unfree 

Both of you had promised to stay
An ethereal memory, to never go away
Now I stand abandoned in the middle of a war
A separation I would no longer dare implore

I’ve been replaced, yet again
Been so used to it, an absence of pain

I miss the days when we’d be together 
I promised to look after you forever
Childhood memories once sweet, now laced with poison 
To seal the deal, both sides must work in liaison  
```
