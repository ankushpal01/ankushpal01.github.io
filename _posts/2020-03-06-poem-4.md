```
Before the crack of dawn
I lit another one as I strolled around the balcony 
All of my remorse and affection long gone
While hedonism took over, haywire sense of morality

“You stand here, yet your mind continues to wander,”
Started a raspy yet sickeningly sweet voice
I put it off as the trick of my mind as I began to ponder
“It’s the sixth night you’ve been at it, but still nothing to rejoice.”

A sense of mockery, dread and abysmal failure washed over
A conversation with the unnaturally chilly wind 
All the while, I struggled to remember how it felt to once be sober
All over the place state of mind while I’m quarantined

I unknowingly yet willingly went ahead with the Faustian bargain
As long as I gave the word to put the incident in writing 
I now have nothing left to lose, but everything to gain 
Another ‘switch’ lit up, I stood prepared for the pact signing 
```
