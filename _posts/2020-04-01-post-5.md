```
I’m sitting in the smallest room
While the air is filled with gloom
Falling into an impending doom 
Where my thoughts can bloom

Talk to me about your favourite memories
All your beautiful treacheries
I promise to hide them cleverly 
While you fall into a reverie

Why won’t you say anything 
Dissolve the quiet, soothe the sting
Liquid ruby dripping over your aquamarine ring
Your flight constrained by your disheveled wing

My favourite sound’s a blood-curdling scream
Or an eerie silence, a perfect dream
While we both try to bring down my self-esteem
Flowing along the wild stream
```
